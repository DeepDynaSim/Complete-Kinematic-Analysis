Newton_Raphson_optimized.m:
The provided code is a MATLAB script for implementing the Newton-Raphson method to solve a system of nonlinear equations. Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

Purpose of the Script:

The main aim is to solve a system of nonlinear equations using the Newton-Raphson method, a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to nonlinear equations.
Defining the System of Equations (fn):

The script defines a function fn using a function handle in MATLAB. This function represents the system of nonlinear equations to be solved.
The system consists of three equations with three variables (v(1), v(2), v(3)), forming a vector v.
Defining the Jacobian Function (jacob_fn):

Another function jacob_fn is defined to represent the Jacobian matrix of the system of equations.
The Jacobian matrix is crucial for the Newton-Raphson method as it provides the derivatives of the functions concerning the variables.
Initial Parameters:

tolerance is set to 10^-5, establishing the precision level for the solution.
An initial guess for the variables is provided in vector v.
max_iterations limits the number of iterations to prevent infinite loops in cases where the method does not converge.
Main Execution:

The Newton-Raphson method is executed by calling the function NewtonRaphson_nl, passing the initial guess, the function, its Jacobian, maximum iterations, and tolerance as arguments.
The results, including the final values of v, the number of iterations taken, and the final error norm, are displayed using fprintf.
NewtonRaphson_nl Function:

This is a custom function implementing the Newton-Raphson method.
It accepts the initial guess, the nonlinear function, its Jacobian, maximum iterations, and the tolerance as inputs.
The function iteratively updates the guess using the Newton-Raphson formula until the solution converges within the specified tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
The output includes the final solution v_final, the number of iterations num_iterations, and the norm of the final error final_norm.
Error Handling and Iterative Process:

The function checks for default values of tolerance and max_iterations if they are not specified.
Within a loop, it calculates the Jacobian matrix and updates the solution vector v_final.
The loop continues until the error norm is less than the tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
This script demonstrates a practical application of the Newton-Raphson method in numerical analysis, particularly useful for engineers and scientists dealing with nonlinear systems. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of the main script and the function definition, making it both efficient and easy to understand.

fourbarmechanism_kinematicanalysis.m

The MATLAB script you've provided is designed for the kinematic analysis of a four-bar linkage mechanism. It focuses on calculating and plotting the positions, velocities, and accelerations of the mechanism's components. Here's an in-depth description:

Velocity and Acceleration Extraction (Symbolically):

The commented-out portion at the beginning suggests an initial plan to use symbolic computation for deriving expressions for velocity and acceleration. However, these lines are commented and not used in the actual computations.
Defining Physical Parameters:

The script sets the physical parameters of the mechanism, like the lengths of the arms (L2, L3, L4) and offsets (LDE, LAE).
Simulation Parameters:

Nmax: The maximum number of iterations for the numerical solver.
x: An initial guess for the angles of bars 3 and 4 (θ3, θ4).
xe: A tolerance for errors in the numerical solution.
dth: The step size for incrementing the driving angle θ2.
th2: The range of the driving angle θ2.
w2 and acc2: The angular velocity and acceleration of arm 2, are assumed to be constant for the simulation.
Preallocating Arrays for Results:

Arrays are initialized to store the results for angles, velocities, and accelerations of arms 3 and 4 (θ3, θ4, ω3, ω4, α3, α4).
Main Loop for Kinematic Analysis:

The script iterates over each value of θ2.
In each iteration, it uses a numerical method (presumably Newton-Raphson or a similar approach) to solve for the positions of θ3 and θ4.
The Jacobian matrix J is used in this process, and a check for singularity is performed to ensure numerical stability.
If the solution converges, the script calculates the velocities (ω3, ω4) and accelerations (α3, α4) using the Jacobian matrix and the known velocities and accelerations of arm 2.
Error Handling:

The script includes error handling to display warnings when the Jacobian is near singular or when the solution does not converge.
Plotting Results:

The script generates plots for the angles, velocities, and accelerations of arms 3 and 4 as functions of the driving angle θ2.
It uses subplots to display these results in a structured manner.
Overall, this script demonstrates a comprehensive approach to kinematic analysis of a four-bar mechanism using numerical methods. It includes detailed calculations for position, velocity, and acceleration, along with error handling and result visualization. The use of preallocation for arrays and checks for numerical stability showcase good programming practices in MATLAB.

The links and points are plotted and updated in the figure for each frame of the animation.
Each frame is captured and written to the video file.
Finalizing the Video:

The video writer is closed after completing the animation loop.
Plotting Kinematic Properties:
